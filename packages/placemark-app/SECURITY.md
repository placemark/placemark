# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Placemark is deployed at a single version and only that version is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/placemark/placemark/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Placemark team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial
reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a
vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
