          Placemark supports three different kinds of circles: Mercator,
          Geodesic, and Degrees. How are these different, and when might you
          want to use each of them?

        <p>
          These are circles that will <em>look like circles</em> on the map.
          They won't be ovals or semicircles: they’ll look like circles. This is
          because they’re drawn according to the{" "}

          . These circles will also look like circles on standard Mapbox,
          Google, and other kinds of web maps.

        <div className="font-bold pb-1 pt-4">Geodesic circles</div>
        <i>A circle with a radius</i>
        <p>
          These are circles with real-world radiuses. You can draw a geodesic
          circle with a radius of "100 miles" or "1,000 meters" and it'll cover
          that geographical area. On a web mercator map, and on most other kinds
          of web maps, these circles will look elliptical, depending on where
          they're located.

        <div className="font-bold pb-1 pt-4">Degree circles</div>

          These are circles with radiuses set in degrees longitude & latitude
          units.
